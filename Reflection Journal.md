## Reflective Journal

### From the Top, and a little late...

#### 04-11-2024

This is probably a little late to be writing the first reflective journal entry, but better late than never! Also, I'll never judge anyone with inconsistent updates 
on projects ever again - remembering to do this requires an alarm clock or something.

After successfully pitching Project: Self to the Behaviour Grant Committee, I'm getting to make my dissertation game with supplementary pay and support from an 
amazing group of makers. This is particularly special because it is the first time I've won a grant! Yay me! So between now and Sept 2025 I'll be working on 
this game, though I'll likely be using an earlier version of the game for the actual dissertation chapter I plan to write about the game, so that I can wrap this
PhD swiftly. 

#### What is the game?

Project: Self (working title) is a "dating" sim, interactive fiction game about nurturing your relationships with the parts of you that need reconciling and impact 
your self-esteem and persona. Procrastination, your inner child, rage, defence (defense?) mechanisms, and impostor syndrome. This all takes place in a building 
that wants to form a tenancy group to hold the landlord responsible for not fixing the various issues in the building. The player's goal is to get each of the NPCs 
to sign up to be a part of this group, but they each have a reason to want to avoid doing so. You build a non-romantic relationship with each of these personified traits to 
gain insights as to why and encourage them to sign up. 

#### What are my goals?

1. A game that conveys emotionally mature material through a light-hearted experience.
2. Players to walk away from the experience being able to identify each of the characters' themes - or closely identify them.
3. A closer examination as to how a game shifts from start to finish, especially when built around emotional game design.

I might add to these as I go, but for now these are my foundational ones. 

Also, I don't have a specific plan as to when I'll update these reflective journals (something we've discussed at length in the GaR project), but I'll try to at least once a month! It depends on how much momentum there is at a time.
