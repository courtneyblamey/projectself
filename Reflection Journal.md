## Reflective Journal

### From the Top, and a little late...

#### 04-11-2024

This is probably a little late to be writing the first reflective journal entry, but better late than never! Also, I'll never judge anyone with inconsistent updates 
on projects ever again - remembering to do this requires an alarm clock or something.

After successfully pitching Project: Self to the Behaviour Grant Committee, I'm getting to make my dissertation game with supplementary pay and support from an 
amazing group of makers. This is particularly special because it is the first time I've won a grant! Yay me! So between now and Sept 2025 I'll be working on 
this game, though I'll likely be using an earlier version of the game for the actual dissertation chapter I plan to write about the game, so that I can wrap this
PhD swiftly. 

#### What is the game?

Project: Self (working title) is a "dating" sim, interactive fiction game about nurturing your relationships with the parts of you that need reconciling and impact 
your self-esteem and persona. Procrastination, your inner child, rage, defence (defense?) mechanisms, and impostor syndrome. This all takes place in a building 
that wants to form a tenancy group to hold the landlord responsible for not fixing the various issues in the building. The player's goal is to get each of the NPCs 
to sign up to be a part of this group, but they each have a reason to want to avoid doing so. You build a non-romantic relationship with each of these personified traits to 
gain insights as to why and encourage them to sign up. 

#### What are my goals?

1. A game that conveys emotionally mature material through a light-hearted experience.
2. Players to walk away from the experience being able to identify each of the characters' themes - or closely identify them.
3. A closer examination as to how a game shifts from start to finish, especially when built around emotional game design.

I might add to these as I go, but for now these are my foundational ones. 

Also, I don't have a specific plan as to when I'll update these reflective journals (something we've discussed at length in the GaR project), but I'll try to at least once a month! It depends on how much momentum there is at a time.

### She's committiiiiing

#### 09-12-2024

I've officially added the game file to the main (?) branch. There was a lot of Googling to make sure this didn't break anything, because "fetch" and "staging" are completely new words to me. But it is there! And now in theory, when I update the script (which I will now check) it will push here. There's a weird fumbling vulnerability with all of this, where I know folks are very aware and familiar with how to do this and I truly feel like I am taking my first Bambi-style steps into it all. In the same vein, I'm not converting this from a docs file, I'm typing it right into the code editor. Maybe that'll do something funky with the commits, idk. I'm definitely going to get things wrong, and need some guidance in keeping this all relatively sensical (in terms of where commits are coming from and pushes etc.) but I'm happy it didn't take me too long to set this up! I am going to edit the test script I have to see if it does anything, and I also have more reflections/updates that I'll need to do retroactively this week (I have two demo-weeks worth of feedback I'd like to document). With many plates spinning it definitely feels like a routine is necessary to avoid these reflections being somewhat scattered, but equally just in developing the game, it is a little haphazard and "when I have time" like the dissertation. I think this is just the plight of the contemporary grad student though. As I wrap this up, I will note that I did suggest a monthly update, so I'm SORT OF on track in that light. yay. Okay, off to see if edits, commits, and pushes are doing what they should.
