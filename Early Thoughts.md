What does the player do?



* Chat
    * Players can converse with the “others” (selves?) through dialogue choices.
    * Players will answer some preliminary questions as character customisation which will start them off on higher rankings with the selves (more hearts, more stars, however I want to represent it semantically).
* Socialise
    * Gifts?
    * “Dates” - players can dedicate spending time with the others, selecting locations, activities that could heal them best? 
    * Love meter
* Inner Voice
    * Do you listen to your inner voice?

Characters

**Impostor Syndrome**



* A high-achieving professional who isn’t sure that they belong anywhere.
* A straight A+ student?
* Celebrity?
* Corporate sweetheart? (lol - like someone who is just kiiiiilling it at their job)

**Inner Child**



* A once care-free person who grew up too fast.
* Cold, a little distant?
* Has responsibility.

**(Coping) Defence Mechanisms**



* A jokester type who doesn’t take anything seriously.
* Laissez-faire, a little careless.

**Rage**



* A quiet, withdrawn person who stays away from people for fear of saying the wrong thing.
* 

**Procrastination**



* Someone who helps others but never helps themselves, until the last moment.

Other thoughts:



* There needs to be stakes - you can fail to reconcile or heal the Other. I remember HPF not really having stakes… other than getting the achievements. It was a very well curated vibe.

Things to think about:



* How am I representing these characters? Are they abstract? Look-a-likes? Metaphors? I feel like I need to know what they look like and be able even to write them.
    * They won’t be super abstract, not blobs or squiggles and shapes - they need a human form.
* Is there a larger narrative plot that isn’t just connecting with each Other?
    * Someone is trying to sell off the building (might be construed for a suicide metaphor, and that’s not what I want to go with, so will need to be careful with how I frame it if I choose something like this).
    * Maybe look at other larger plots in other dating sims?
