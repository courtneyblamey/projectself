Name: Lynda 

Occupation: Project Manager at Tech Start-Up

Pronouns: she/her

Age: 40s

Bio: Lynda is a career-driven woman in her 40s. She loves to bring levity to her team during hard deadline pushes, but rules the space with decorum and professionalism when needed.  she has a long-distance partner who is equally career focused, and they regularly video call, and see each other once every month - longer when the holidays roll in. She has two cats, Treacle and Bean. She has fought hard over the last two decades to garner the respect she now has, though didn’t start out in Tech. She’s worked in a breadth of industries, from beauty, to healthcare, to marketing - and is often invited to colleges and high schools to talk about her career trajectory. However, she recently started her job at a Tech Start up and feelings of impostor syndrome are blossoming - do I belong here? Have I done enough to earn this position? Could I be doing something better? How have I fluked my way into this role? This isn’t something entirely new to her, but the self-doubt is louder than normal lately.

**Inner Child**



* *A once care-free person who grew up too fast.*
* *Cold, a little distant?*
* *Has responsibility.*

**(Coping) Defence Mechanisms**



* *A jokester type who doesn’t take anything seriously.*
* *Laissez-faire, a little careless.*

**Rage**



* *A quiet, withdrawn person who stays away from people for fear of saying the wrong thing.*

**Procrastination**



* *Someone who helps others but never helps themselves, until the last moment.*

*Other thoughts:*



* *There needs to be stakes - you can fail to reconcile or heal the Other. I remember HPF not really having stakes… other than getting the achievements. It was a very well curated vibe.*
