**Impostor Syndrome**



* *A high-achieving professional who isn’t sure that they belong anywhere.*
* *A straight A+ student?*
* *Celebrity?*
* *Corporate sweetheart? (lol - like someone who is just kiiiiilling it at their job)*

Name: Lynda 

Occupation: Project Manager at Tech Start-Up

Pronouns: she/her

Age: 40s

Motivations: Seeing her team succeed. Striving for targets and deadlines, often over-delivering.

Flaws: No work-life balance. Feels job could be taken away from her at a moment’s notice.

Perfect day-off: What day off? Just kidding. Curled up on the couch with a good glass of wine, the cats, her partner, and a historical drama series - and not having to cook.

Bio: Lynda is a career-driven woman in her 40s. She loves to bring levity to her team during hard deadline pushes, but rules the space with decorum and professionalism when needed.  she has a long-distance partner who is equally career focused, and they regularly video call, and see each other once every month - longer when the holidays roll in. She has two cats, Treacle and Bean. She has fought hard over the last two decades to garner the respect she now has, though didn’t start out in Tech. She’s worked in a breadth of industries, from beauty, to healthcare, to marketing - and is often invited to colleges and high schools to talk about her career trajectory. However, she recently started her job at a Tech Start up and feelings of impostor syndrome are blossoming - do I belong here? Have I done enough to earn this position? Could I be doing something better? How have I fluked my way into this role? This isn’t something entirely new to her, but the self-doubt is louder than normal lately.

Apartment: A two-bed, so that she can host friends who come visit in the city. She’s renting because she recently moved to The City for her new job. Once she knows permanency, she might end up buying somewhere.

**Inner Child**



* *A once care-free person who grew up too fast.*
* *Cold, a little distant?*
* *Has responsibility.*

Name: Antony

Occupation: Barista / Bartender

Pronouns: he/him

Age: mid-late 20s

Motivations: Wants the best for his little (half) sister, because he doesn’t want to see someone go through what he did growing up. Enjoys his craft.

Flaws: Shuts down quickly when critiqued or in a situation he doesn’t like. Struggles to talk through feelings or identify them.

Perfect day-off: Taking his little sister out for brunch in the morning, hanging with friends doing something active (axe throwing, climbing, bike ride) and chilling at a bar in the evening.

Bio: Antony may be a little closed off, but that doesn’t make him a total introvert. Working two gigs to save up to maybe some day get onto the old property ladder he is fuelled by good coffee and dad jokes (when his friends and co-workers permit him). After his dad passed away and his siblings started to fight more, especially when his stepdad hit the scene, he didn’t get much of a voice in his house growing up. You did as you were told, and you were welcome to argue, but it was wasted breath. He worked hard at school to keep up with his peers, but it always seemed like an impossible feat - he still did well, but not well enough for his mother’s approval. Surrounded by a lot of bullying in the home and at school, Antony finds it hard to let people in, but has curated a good, tight, friend group who keep him laughing.

Apartment: Studio, but a reasonably sized one. Recently switched out the couch bed for a real bed. Has lived there about 4 years now.

**(Coping) Defence Mechanisms**



* *A jokester type who doesn’t take anything seriously.*
* *Laissez-faire, a little careless.*
* Hiding pain underneath the surface

Name: Sasha

Occupation: Freelance Illustrator

Pronouns: she/they

Age: 30s

Motivations: Defining a distinct art style they can call their own, making rent, making good art - whatever that means. Bringing joy to others around them.

Flaws: Self-deprecating jokes, doesn’t take anything too seriously (though is that entirely a flaw?). A “everything will work out” attitude to their own detriment at times.

Perfect day-off: Going to art museums for sketching inspiration or craft fairs and spending more money than they promised themself they would.

Bio: Sasha is witty, silly, and a beacon of light in people’s dark days. Their style is unmatched in vibes and their creativity seeps into most corners of their life. They live with their dog Comet. Sasha is currently on the dating scene in The City and can provide all kinds of wild first-date stories. After some bad experiences at art school (and one really bad break up), and losing contact with a couple family members, Sasha decided to move away from where they grew up and start a life to call their own. They’ve been working as a moderately successful freelance illustrator for 5 years, with regular purchases made on her website, though it hasn’t been getting much traction as of late. Even when the going gets rough, Sasha has a quip for the occasion.

Apartment: 1 bedroom, decorated with dopamine decor (bright colours, fun gimmick-y pieces). They’ve lived there 7 years now.

* *There needs to be stakes - you can fail to reconcile or heal the Other. I remember HPF not really having stakes… other than getting the achievements. It was a very well curated vibe.*
