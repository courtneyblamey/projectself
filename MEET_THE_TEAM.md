“You shuffle the last box of your things through the main door of the apartment building, adding to the small pile you’ve accrued in the entryway.”

M “Finally!”

“You drop the box on the ground, knowing it held only sweaters, and enjoy the release of weight in your arms for a brief moment.”

(unknown) “I hope you have a ground floor apartment.”

“You pivot to see a curly-haired person examining your pile with a grimace.”

M “Uh… that depends, is 202 on the ground floor?”

Unknown “It is not.”

“Agh, tits.”

J “Is it just you moving this stuff?”

M “Yeah, I was going to hire movers but I left it too late and then they were booked so I managed to shove this all in a friends car and then ferry it in from the sidewalk and now…”

“You glance at the pile that now seems… bigger than before.”

“You look to the unnamed person.”

M “I’m &lt;playername>.”

J “Oh, Jasper. Hi!”

“They extend a hand and you shake it.”

M “Nice to meet you! I wish I was slightly less sweaty, but y’know - moving.”

J “You want some help bringing these upstairs?”

“A pang of panic hits you.”

M “There’s no elevator?!”

J “Oh there is it is just broken right now…”


## CHOICE



1. Curse the gods for their taking delight in your suffering.
2. Sigh dejectedly and sit down for a moment.
3. Laugh, and lift up a box.


### **Curse the gods**

M “Why do you forsake me oh CRUEL DEITIES.”

“Jasper looks up at the sky with you and shakes their fist.”

J “Yeah, what is your problem gods!?”

“You chuckle with Jasper.”

### **Sigh dejectedly**

“Your shoulders drop as you plant yourself on top of the box labelled “sweaters”. It gives a little, but not enough to bust the tape keeping it shut.”

M “You know, I really should have checked that when I got here.”

J “Most don’t anticipate a broken elevator.”

“You drop your face into your hands with a chuckle.”

M “I was promised an elevator.”

### **Laugh and lift up a box**

“You throw your head back with a solid laugh.”

M “Oh, of *course*.”

M “Well, they aren’t going to take themselves up, I guess.”

“You grab a box and a couple bags, while Jasper picks up a laundry basket you filled with some books, shirts, and loose cables.”

“They regard the chaos within the basket as you both make your way up the stairs.”

J “Now, I’m not one to knock a personal organisation system but-”

M “Yeah, I got flustered at the end and just started to shove things into carriable containers.”

M “So now books and electronics are buddies.”

J “Gotcha.”

“You reach the apartment door with ‘202’ stencilled onto it.”

M “Home, sweet home.”

“You fumble for a key in your jeans pocket and unlock the door.”

“The door squeaks open into your new, relatively spacious, studio apartment. A little kitchen area is tucked away on the right, after the bathroom door. A set of three windows line the wall in front of you, with one on the left wall.”

“You’re happy the corner apartment was available. There’s so much light in here. You wanted that.”

“Or maybe you needed it.”

J “All good?”

M “Oh! Yeah. I just-”


## **CHOICE**



1. Share
2. Overshare


### **Share**

M “My old place just didn’t have a lot of natural light and so I’m really happy that this one does. I wanted this unit a *lot*. Even if the price point is…”

“You trail off. You know that you might be paying a little more than you should, but now you get to live out your dreams of being a sentient houseplant. Photosynthesis and vitamin D is but a sunny afternoon away.”

**Set $ ShareSkill to 3**


### **Overshare**

M “I think my old place was making me really depressed, because there was no decent sunlight in it, and I felt like sometimes, the walls were closing in, and I got this vertigo sensation any time I would get home because I knew I was back in a place that wasn’t home but a stop along the way, so I never felt fully at ease there - which probably contributed to insomnia and always feeling on edge whenever I wasn’t home.”

“So I got this place, thank god, and I paid *way* more than I should have for a studio, but it has windows, and I think I’m now realising that if the sunlight isn’t the problem, then maybe it is me.”
