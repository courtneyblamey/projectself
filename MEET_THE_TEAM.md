"Choices you make along the way will shape who you are. That could be your cafe order or how you handle social situations. Dialogue choices will skew according to your choices."

"Enjoy!"

"You shuffle the last box of your things through the main door of the apartment building, adding to the small pile you've accrued in the entryway."

M "Finally!"

"You drop the box on the ground, knowing it held only sweaters, and enjoy the release of weight in your arms for a brief moment."

(unknown) "I hope you have a ground floor apartment."

"You pivot to see a curly-haired person examining your pile with a grimace."

M "Uh… that depends, is 202 on the ground floor?"

Unknown "It is not."

"Agh, tits."

J "Is it just you moving this stuff?"

M "Yeah, I was going to hire movers but I left it too late and then they were booked so I managed to shove this all in a friends car and then ferry it in from the sidewalk and now…"

"You glance at the pile that now seems… bigger than before."

"You look to the unnamed person."

M "I'm &lt;playername>."

J "Oh, Jasper. Hi!"

"They extend a hand and you shake it."

M "Nice to meet you! I wish I was slightly less sweaty, but y'know - moving."

J "You want some help bringing these upstairs?"

"A pang of panic hits you."

M "There's no elevator?!"

J "Oh there is it is just broken right now…"


## CHOICE



1. Curse the gods for their taking delight in your suffering.
2. Sigh dejectedly and sit down for a moment.
3. Laugh, and lift up a box.


### **Curse the gods**

M "Why do you forsake me oh CRUEL DEITIES."

"Jasper looks up at the sky with you and shakes their fist."

J "Yeah, what is your problem gods!?"

"You chuckle with Jasper."

**jump carryingboxes1**


### **Sigh dejectedly**

"Your shoulders drop as you plant yourself on top of the box labelled "sweaters". It gives a little, but not enough to bust the tape keeping it shut."

M "You know, I really should have checked that when I got here."

J "Most don't anticipate a broken elevator."

"You drop your face into your hands with a chuckle."

M "I was promised an elevator."

**jump carryingboxes1**


### **Laugh and lift up a box**

"You throw your head back with a solid laugh."

M "Oh, of *course*."

**jump carryingboxes1**

**label carryingboxes1**

M "Well, they aren't going to take themselves up, I guess."

"You grab a box and a couple bags, while Jasper picks up a laundry basket you filled with some books, shirts, and loose cables."

"They regard the chaos within the basket as you both make your way up the stairs."

J "Now, I'm not one to knock a personal organisation system but-"

M "Yeah, I got flustered at the end and just started to shove things into carriable containers."

M "So now books and electronics are buddies."

J "Gotcha."

"You reach the apartment door with '202' stencilled onto it."

M "Home, sweet home."

"You fumble for a key in your jeans pocket and unlock the door."

**label homesweethome1**

"The door squeaks open into your new, relatively spacious, studio apartment. A little kitchen area is tucked away on the right, after the bathroom door. A set of three windows line the wall in front of you, with one on the left wall."

"You're happy the corner apartment was available. There's so much light in here. You wanted that."

"Or maybe you needed it."

J "All good?"

M "Oh! Yeah. I just-"


## **CHOICE**



1. I'm just happy for some natural light for a little extra a month. (Share)
2. My old place made me miserable and question what brings me joy. (Overshare)


### **Share**

M "My old place just didn't have a lot of natural light and so I'm really happy that this one does. I wanted this unit a *lot*. Even if the price point is…"

"You trail off. You know that you might be paying a little more than you should, but now you get to live out your dreams of being a sentient houseplant, sitting in the sun. Photosynthesis and vitamin D is but a sunny afternoon away."

**Set $ ShareSkill to 3**

**jump keepcool1**


### **Overshare**

M "I think my old place was making me really depressed, because there was no decent sunlight in it, and I felt like sometimes, the walls were closing in, and I got this vertigo sensation any time I would get home because I knew I was back in a place that wasn't home but a stop along the way, so I never felt fully at ease there - which probably contributed to insomnia and always feeling on edge whenever I wasn't home."

"So I got this place, thank god, and I paid *way* more than I should have for a studio, but it has windows, and I think I'm now realising that if the sunlight isn't the problem, then maybe it is me."

J "I get it. It's a fresh start too, right?"

M "Yeah, exactly. And it seems like the landlord is more chill about decorating. My last one wouldn't even let me hang things."

"There's a flicker of something in Jasper's eyes."

J "Yeah, they're chill on that front."

J "Anyway, let's get some more of those boxes!"

"Jasper places the laundry basket in the space, and follows you back out and down the stairs."

**jump carryingboxes2**

**label isitme1**

"A quiet hangs in the air."

J "That's a lot of big feelings for one studio apartment with windows."

"Jasper smiles at you."

J "It sounds like you're taking big steps right now."

M "Yeah. Sorry. That was a lot-"

"Jasper waves their hand as you."

J "Nah, means you're in touch with yourself. Don't worry."

"They place your basket of things into the space, and looks to you once more."

J "Let's get the rest of your stuff in here."

"You nod with determination and you both head back downstairs."

**jump carryingboxes2**

"After about 30 minutes, you and Jasper have managed to ferry the majority of your things to your apartment."

"A pile of sort-of labelled boxes, a plastic wrapped mattress, a small bookshelf covered in stickers, console, TV, and TV stand all sit in the middle of the room."

J "Wait…I feel like you're missing furniture."

M "Oh yeah, that's coming later today. Evening delivery. Yay convenience culture."

J "If you were going for the mattress on the floor vibe I wouldn't have judged. I didn't get a bed frame for like…"

**If $ jasper_rating = 5**

J "Well, longer than I should have."

**Else**

J "Four months?"

J "So like I said - no judgement here."

"They look at their phone."

J "OH *SHIT*."

M "What? What's wrong?"

"Jasper frantically types something on their phone."

J "Oh, I am going to be *very* late for work."

"They look up at you, eyes wide."

J "I have to go. You're good?"

M "Yeah! Thank you for your help!"

J "No problem, sorry to rush out."

"Jasper waves a quick goodbye as they disappear out of the doorway. You hear their quick footsteps down the hallway and then the stairs."

"You turn to look at the room, now a little smaller with your things all in it, and sigh."

"Your stomach grumbles. Perhaps it is time for some lunch?"

"Locking up the apartment, you decide to head out and explore the neighbourhood for something to eat."

**label meetingantony1**

"After a short while of strolling along the streets of your new neighbourhood, you spot a place across the street. A teal facade with "Cafe Midi" painted in white and black on top of the doorway."

"Fresh pastries daily. Locally roasted coffee. Vinyl vibes."

"*That seems millennial enough for me.*"

"You head into the cafe."

"The aroma of freshly brewed coffee hits you as you walk through the door. The space is bright, with a small number of tables and chairs populated by a group of women catching up, a family and their dog after a walk, and a pair of older men chatting about where they want to go on holiday next."

"The teal theme from the facade continues across the front of the coffee bar and the menus. Soft jazz is playing in the background. You join the queue."

"It doesn't take long before you reach the front."

A "What can I get you today?"

"You turn to see a concerned face framed by a sharp dark bob. In their hands is a bright blue leash with a cute pawprint pattern along it, and at the end is a *very* excited dog."

"You re-enter the building after an evening walk, making most of the remaining daylight at dusk and prepare to climb the stairs. A woman emerges from the stairwell holding a laundry basket."

"She looks to be in her late 40s, with some hints of grey in her hair wrapped up into a messy bun, though it looks so done with intention that it looks tidy."

"A set of well-manicured nails peek overtop the laundry basket handle and a gentle smell of lavender lingers in the air."

L "I thought I heard some chatter this morning outside my window - are you the one I heard telling someone 'no one will steal my stuff from the sidewalk it's 10am'?"

"You recall a joking exchange between yourself and your friend over ferrying things indoors when they had to leave. They looked guilty, but you didn't want them to worry. Plus, stealing is a night crime, everyone knows that."
